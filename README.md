## What We Build

Our work spans three layers. **Research** provides foundational tooling. **Technologies** are usable implementations of that research. **Systems** are emergent, abstract patterns that are constructed from technology activity. Proccess, not object.

Some links are functional, other repositories are still hidden, but in progress. 

### Research

| Project | Description | Release |
|:--------|:------------|
| **[HYPHAKERNEL](https://github.com/Hyphaeic/HYPHAKERNEL)** | Bare-metal Rust exokernel for WASM processes with deterministic, clockless scheduling | [UNRELEASED] |
| **[STOK-CORE](https://github.com/Hyphaeic/STOK-CORE)** | GPU-accelerated State-Time Option Kernels for real-time predictive feasibility maps | [UNRELEASED - COMPLETED] |
| **[FDRS](https://github.com/Hyphaeic/fdrs)** | Variable-radix computational geometry enabling isolated, orthogonal timeline operations with seamless phase transitions | [UNRELEASED]

## Applications

Our framework seeks to enable:

- **Embodied AGI** — Sovereign, unified compute substrate for physical bodies. Agents that are *of* the world, not merely *in* it.
- **RTOS with Provable Timing** — Heterogeneous cadences (μs control loops, ms sensor fusion, s logging) without forcing a global clock. Deadlines become cylinder membership constraints, not floating numbers.
- **Decentralised Inference** — Mesh compute where topology emerges from operation, not configuration. Extension is growth, not integration.
- **Unified Hierarchical Memory** — RAM, storage, network collapsed into single locality. No replication, no consensus, shared state.
- **Autonomous Manufacturing** — Machine embodiment for self-operating production. We have plans to embody a CNC machine using FPGAs as an early testbed for processing closed-loop, physical agency.

FDRS provides the mathematical foundation—provable locality, compositional time, ultrametric distance—that makes these applications tractable rather than aspirational.
