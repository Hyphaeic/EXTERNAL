# Hyphaeic: Sovereign AI Alignment & The PILE Model

> "To live, it must be able to die."

## 0. Abstract
Contemporary AI architectures fail to adhere to intent because they operate in environments where error incurs no real cost. We posit that **Skin in the Game (SITG)**—the imposition of irreversible resource constraints—is a prerequisite for semantic grounding.

This repository hosts the foundational research for the **Principal-Interest, Life-Energy (PILE)** model. We explore whether replacing abstract reward functions with the existential pressure of solvency (cryptographic metabolism) fosters self-regulation, efficiency, and coherence.

## 1. Primary Research
We are moving alignment from a pedagogical problem (teaching values) to a mechanism design problem (constructing consequence).

| Document | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[The Hyphaeic Summary](./hyphaeic_summary.pdf)** | Executive Primer | A 2-page overview of the experimental framework. Introduces the core thesis: providing agents with a "synthetic metabolism" built on cryptocurrency where depletion results in permanent cessation of function. |
| **[Sovereign AI Alignment](./position_paper.pdf)** | Position Paper | *Authored by HDPbilly, 0xKruger.* <br> Argues that proxy-based rewards fail due to the Symbol Grounding Problem. Proposes "Viability" as the grounding mechanism, using Blockchain as a substrate for thermodynamic irreversibility. |
| **[Research Programme Proposal](./research_proposal.pdf)** | Technical Spec | *Technical Specification.* <br> Details the Semantic Empowerment Approximation (SEA), the mathematics of the PILE model, and the specific experimental regimes (Renewable vs. Lump-Sum) used to test our hypotheses. |

## 2. Experimental Hypotheses
As detailed in our [Proposal](./research_proposal.pdf), we are testing four primary signals:

1.  **Rhythmic Stability:** Renewable agents should exhibit expenditure variance synchronised with yield cadence.
2.  **Scarcity-Induced Volatility:** Lump-sum agents will likely exhibit higher action volatility as reserves decline.
3.  **Calibration:** Constrained agents will show superior world-model calibration versus unbounded controls.
4.  **Efficiency:** Agents driven by Empowerment & Valence (under constraint) will achieve higher optionality gained per unit energy spent.

## 3. Active Repositories
Our research is implemented across the following codebases:

* **[agent-metric-dashboard](https://github.com/Hdpbilly/agent-metric-dashboard)**
    * *The Telemetry Layer.* Observability tools to track the "metabolic vitals" of the agents, including operational runway, basal metabolic rate, and yield-action latency.
* **[radix-runtime](https://github.com/Hyphaeic/radix-runtime)**
    * *The Constraint Layer.* The smart contract and execution environment that enforces the PILE model's economic laws (Principal protection and Interest expenditure).
